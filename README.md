# todotxt.js

A JavaScript parser and container for the TODO files in the [todo.txt format][format].

This project does things quite similarly to [jsTodoTxt][jsTodoTxt]; it also:

-   Has a list container that allows for actions on the list (such as add, append, pri, sorting etc.) from the CLI tool.
-   Should be both client and server compatible.
-   Contains an EBNF notation.

> Why not fork? I wanted to have a bash at building a JS lib from scratch :)

Primarily developed for a [todotxt-demo][https://github.com/rmasters/todotxt-demo] app.
